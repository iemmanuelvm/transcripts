 This section of the course is all about using multivariate methods to do source separation or dimension reduction, if you'd like some background knowledge for this section of the course, then I can recommend going to my YouTube page. And if you look on the top row, the playlist for ANSO analyzing neural time series number nine Matrix analysis. And if you click in here, you'll see there are five videos in here. You can watch all of them. The least relevant video for this section of the course is this one, these squares fitting. So it's a good video, of course, but the most relevant ones are one, three, four and five for this section. And if you're really interested in the topics I discussed here, I can the composition generalized, I can composition and so forth. Then I can also recommend my course dimensioned reduction and source separation in neuroscience. In this course, I go into a lot more detail, including a lot more mathematical detail about the topics covered in this section. However, I believe that watching these four videos or maybe all five, if you want to watch this list, goes on as well. These videos in this playlist will give you sufficient background information to follow and complete all of the videos and the projects in this section.
